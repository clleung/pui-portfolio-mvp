## Description
**Purpose**
This is meant to be the foundation of a portfolio to be used during my job search next school year.
**Intended Communication of Information**
I hope to communicate information about my prior academic and professional experiences and provide an easy means of accessing my contact information.
**User Interest and Engagement**
Although lacking in animation, I tried applying a colorful background to the home page. 
**Target Audience**
Recruiters and potential employers.

## Using the Website
* Interaction Type
* navigation bar
- select a tab up top
* project cards
- click on each to open into modals
* icons
- click on icons to email, linkedin, and github

## External Libraries
* UIKit
- I preferred the visual language over that of Bootstrap
- Just for nav bar and icon stylings
- layout for nav and styling of icons
* Bootstrap
- Its responsive grid was important to make the website partially responsive and the modal components were used to quickly communicate information on the project.
- Responsive grid and modal
- layout for each page
## Iteration from HW 7
* reduced pages that were built out
- wanted to focus more on breadth over depth for this iteration, so I build out more modals instead of individual project pages
* new background
- I wanted to bring some more personality into the site, so I used an SVG background
* icon format
- I needed to focus on integrating the libraries together, so I left icon formatting for the next iteration

## Major Challenges
* integrating external libraries
- determining which stylesheets to prioritize over one another (CSS)
* time constraints
- built out fewer pages
- limited formatting that was build out
- reduced features (tag filtering)
